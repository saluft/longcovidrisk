				<p class="intro">
				Long COVID is estimated to be keeping 4 million Americans out of work, according to <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/new-data-shows-long-covid-is-keeping-as-many-as-4-million-people-out-of-work/">new data</a> from the Brooking Institute. This number accounts for one-third of the current labor shortage in the US. Meanwhile, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that nearly <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/nchs_press_releases/2022/20220622.htm">one in five Americans</a> who've had COVID-19 are living with long COVID. This adds up to about <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-22-105666">23 million Americans</a>. The numbers are large. So, we looked into who is most at risk for developing the condition.

				Long COVID is the umbrella term for new, lingering, and ongoing symptoms caused by a COVID infection. It's known to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/02/19/science/long-covid-causes.html">wreak havoc on the body</a>. Symptoms often include cardiac, neurocognitive, sensory and nervous system dysfunction.
			</p>
            <p>
                The condition can affect people of all ages following a COVID infection, even those with initially asymptomatic and mild cases. To date, studies show that <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n829">middle-aged women are most likely</a> to experience long-term symptoms. After following 200 patients for about three months, researchers <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(22)00072-1#secsectitle0020">uncovered four additional risk factors</a> (regardless of gender) below.

						<figcaption class="graphic-text">Autoantibodies are a type of antibody, a Y-shaped protein produced by the immune system. But rather than fight off infection, as antibodies typically do, autoantibodies attack a person's own tissues. They are linked with autoimmune conditions like lupus, Celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis. People with certain autoantibodies are at an increased risk for developing long COVID.</figcaption>
